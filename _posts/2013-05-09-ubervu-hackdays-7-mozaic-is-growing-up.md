About a year ago we decided to completely rewrite our web-app, make it fast, very fast, make it easily extendable, and make it good. We decided to make a single-page-app that we can be proud of. The hard part was choosing the technology we were going to build it on. After looking, researching, struggling we came up with our very own framework, [Mozaic][2]. The project is open source so you can use it and abuse it at will (and we hope you will).

We&#8217;ve built [Mozaic][2] to be fast, to have highly reusable components (widgets), to support very complex interactions and to be easy to change something in the apps you write. It&#8217;s built on Backbone, Coffeescript (which we&#8217;ve learned to love) and Requires.js.

As our baby is growing and it&#8217;s turning 1 year old we want to celebrate this and make it a present &#8211; tackle some of the cooler or more difficult challenges the framework faces in a one-day [hackathon][3]. We have a list of topics that we would like to tackle. It can be found [here][4].

On the **18th of May** 2013, a Saturday, we&#8217;ll gather at our Bucharest HQ at **10:00 AM** and **code and have fun**.

If you like JS, like web-apps or are just curios about [Mozaic][2] &#8211; be there.** Sign-up** on our [Meetup page][3]. You will find there all the details you need. Oh, and hurry up, we have limited space.

Hope to see you all on the 18th,

uberVU Team
