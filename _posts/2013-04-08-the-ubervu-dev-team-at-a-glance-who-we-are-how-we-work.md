  <strong><span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Who are we?</span></strong>
</p>

We help companies in **35** countries get better marketing results from social media. We are a fastly growing company that focuses on creating amazing, cutting-edge products.

**What do we do?**

Our main product is a **snappy, sexy-looking social media marketing platform**. To build it we use an efficient combination of technologies:

*   We start at the top with a coffeescript interface. We created our own single-page apps framework in order to accommodate our needs (though we did try out backbone.js, knockout.js, ember.js and a few others before we decided to write our own);
*   User data for the interface is provided by a Django+Tastypie+MySQL layer. This REST machine is powered by a smooth codebase which combines models, forms and resources in order to create a simple and easy-to-understand architecture;
*   Our business is data, therefore the largest component of our system is our data acquisition and processing layer. This is a vanilla-python implementation which handles (very) large amounts of information each day. We distribute our data and processing over Amazon EC2 instances with a diverse technology stack: Mongo, Kestrel, DynamoDB, Redis, Memcache, Graphite.

**How do we do it?**

We truly know that the value of the company is in its people. That’s why we always try to bring in members who share the same thinking with us on development, business and life in general. The two traits that best define us are:[

1.  **Smart** &#8211; Everyone here stands out from the crowd in one way or another.[
    ][1]
2.  **Getting Things Done** &#8211; We don’t wait for things to happen, we make them happen.

Every new member of the team comes in knowing that he made the right choice based on the** right reasons**. This means that we eliminate any confusion and uncertainty stress right from the beginning, keeping our minds focused on what we do.

**<span style="font-size: 1.17em;">What’s the team like and how do we organize ourselves?</span>**

The uberVU team is self-organized and passionate about technology. Here is where our pride goes:

**“The only way to do great work is to love what you do!”**

<p dir="ltr">
  We couldn’t have created such a great product in such a short time without being 100% into our work. Even when we take on tasks which are less enjoyable, we find creative solutions in order to make them fun and easier to accomplish. This is what it means to be CRAZY GOOD at what you do and try to become better every day.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>“Management is not a profession but a skill.”</strong>
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  The people we bring in are passionate and responsible. This eliminates the need for having tight management with constant oversight of members. We know that the person sitting next to us is working as hard as we are and is responsible enough to manage his own time, signal any problems and, most important, keep focused on what’s important for the team.<b><b> </b></b>
</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">
  What you&#8217;ll learn if you join uberVU
</h3>

You will learn new programming languages, cutting-edge technologies etc&#8230; yeah, we know this, it’s old. Any place you will do work for has a learning curve. What we like to think you will learn at uberVU, and is more important than any other knowledge, is how to approach problems and tasks properly and, again, how to FINISH THEM! This might sound trivial but it involves many aspects.

Let’s take a programming task, for example: you need to build feature X. Before you even think about coding, you have to:

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    understand the <strong>reasoning</strong> behind the specs (the ‘why?’ part, not just the ‘what to do?’);
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    asses its <strong>priority</strong> (you need to be certain this is the most important thing you should be working on right now);
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    place the task into the <strong>global scope</strong> (how does it fit with existing features? does it introduce new issues in the system that nobody thought about until now?);
  </p>
</li>

<li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">
    plan the implementation and try to <strong>estimate</strong> how long it will take to ship it.<b><b><br /> </b></b>
  </p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">
  Now that you have all of this cleared up you still need to write tests for the feature, write the implementation, have it reviewed, tested, and deployed.
</p>

<b id="internal-source-marker_0.6086335072759539">What’s really special about uberVU is our focus on what really makes this process work: PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. You can’t go through all of these steps without being proficient in: managing and prioritizing your time, breaking down problems into manageable pieces, planning your next actions in a smart way, organizing your thinking and many others.</b>
