On the 2nd of March we had our 6th **hackathon** at uberVU. We wrote code, had a few drinks and met new people. All in all, we think it was a really fun experience. It was our largest hackathon so far, with more than 30 people showing up. As our new offices can handle it, we will go even bigger next time!

Our main topics were **Git**, **GitHub** and the **GitHub API**. In the morning we looked over some ideas we had, we took into consideration we had four teams, and their wishes. At the end of the day gave a little demo of what they built (or tried to build, as you&#8217;ll see). A few more teams came close to having things running, but in the end needed a couple more hours. The projects were language agnostic, we had both Python and Java projects.

**Project 1.** How many times did you leave  #TODO comments in a file and forgot about them? To tackle this ‘problem’, the team made a script which automatically creates an issue when pushing to GitHub, having as description the #TODO comment.

**Project 2.** This was an extension of the [GitHub Survivor project][2]. The team added more filters to the project.

**Project 3.** The team wanted to integrate [Hubot][3] with Campfire. They succeeded to combine the two APIs and the (achieved) result was that when a GitHub Pull Request is made,  a message is posted on Campfire.
*GitHub Project: <https://github.com/arcade/hubot-scripts>*

**Project 4.** A bold project. The team worked to integrate the possibility to take a photo with you mobile phone, and add it as a link to a GitHub issue. They wanted to integrate a mobile app with Dropbox and GitHub, and they succeeded in making 3 independent modules.
