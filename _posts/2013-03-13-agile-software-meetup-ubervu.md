&nbsp;

Yesterday, on March 12th, we were happy to host an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bucharest-Agile-Software-Meetup-Group/" target="_blank">Agile Meetup</a> in our Bucharest office. The presentation, held by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bucharest-Agile-Software-Meetup-Group/members/8511121/" target="_blank" data-memberid="8511121">Alexandru Bolboaca</a>, had a very interesting topic: **Why Agile? Why Scrum? When not to use Scrum? Risks of adopting Agile. **This was the first time when the topic was chosen based  on suggestions by the agile community. The discussion covered both theoretical and practical aspects and tried to pinpoint and answer some of many challenges that arise when trying to implement **Agile methodologies**.

Alongside the pros and cons of **Agile** and **Scrum**, we also came up with best practices and experience-based explanations of the ways these techniques can help software developers in their work. Overall, people were very engaged during the discussion and based on the many reviews received afterwards on the meetup page it seems that everyone left the meeting with something new to think about and try to implement!
