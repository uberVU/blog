  <strong>uberVU</strong> was invited for the second time at <a href="http://cariere.as-mi.ro/">Careers v2.0</a>, a job fair organized by Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science students for students.
</p>

**Vladimir Oane**  and **Mihai Oprea** presented the company, product, goals and what it takes to work at **uberVU**. Overall, why a student would want to join our team and what are the things we&#8217;re looking for in a candidate.

</p>

But what skills do you need to join our team? You have to be **smart**, and **get things done**. Besides showing students the perks of being an uber-employee, we wanted to show them not just what we&#8217;re looking for, but also **why** we think these kind of skills are extremely important.

Mihai discussed our **hiring process**, which is different from others. We break the wall between company and future employees, and we look for **friends**.**** ****
