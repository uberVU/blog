This month we felt like writing a few things on our experience with MongoDB and our friends at 10gen published them on their blog at [blog.mongodb.org](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/86217258713/powering-social-insights-with-mongodb-at-ubervu).

We talk about the challenges we face and the solutions we developed while using MongoDB. We also share how our infrastructure is setup. Give it a look and let us know what you think.
